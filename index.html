  <!-- for readability, I've utilized tabs/indents in my code.  They are NOT required for things to work, but make coding much
		easier to read.  Whenever a tag is opened, the indents increase.  Whenever a tag is closed, I reduce the indents.  That way 
		you can follow an indent straight down and find it's closing tag and easily see all the content that is within.  This is
		one of the best habits you can get into as you learn to code - is indenting and commenting your code.

  <!-- All the greeting card content will be within the DIV below with the id = "greeting_card" -->

        <!-- To replace this image with your own, simply get a link to any image you want.  If you are using dropbox, you can get 
					direct sharing links, the same with Google Drive.  You can also find any image on the internet and right-click on it
					and choose "copy image location" and paste it below.
					The alt parameter is very important, as it should describe your image.  While it is not displayed to the user, it is used
					by screen readers for the visually impaired to explain the content of an image. -->

      <p>Here is another paragraph. This one is longer, so you can see how text-indents work. I really don't have any
        text that goes here, so I'll simply say, stay awesome, be awesome, and never give up. You can do it!</p>
